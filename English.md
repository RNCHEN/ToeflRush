Not all happiness come from working.

1. They can almost do anything they like without worrying about the cost. Doing what they like without considering the cost is a joyful process, which makes people happy. 

   Take me as an example. The reason why I work so hard is that I try to accumulate money for an imaginary journey. The cost of taking the airplane, living in the hotel, going to the restaurant is out of my affordable range. I also need to leave some deposits for the emergency. So I have to work hard to earn the money because that is the only road to achieve my dream. However, those rich people can go anywhere anytime.  Without any consideration, which means they do not need to pay attention to any cost, what they need to do is to enjoy the magnificent view and delicious local food, they will feel happy and joy absolutely. 

2. They can usually solve problems quickly, thus feeling happy. Because controlling the cost is the core problem when doing the projects. 

   Taking the case of my experience in one internship, which has 3 groups to compete for one goal without any assistance in money. We all have the same speed of progress until the last step. There are two solutions and one of them is to buy a server while another one is to optimize the algorithm. Purchasing a server can solve all problems, which is the best choice obviously, but it cost a lot while the optimization needs a lot of time and people but it won't increase the cost. So the other two groups choose this solution. When we are considering about if we can have other solutions, one of the group members say he will buy a server himself and contribute it to our team. We are all excited and then, without any surprise, we finish the task first.

1. The topic pertinent to the issue of the final aim of education has become hotly debated in contemporary society, among which is the discussion about whether the teaching goal is to teach people to educate themselves. Some individuals propose that teachers should teach them specific knowledge instead, citing the reason that it is helpful to their job-hunting. However, as far as I'm concerned, it is more conducive for teachers to teach people how to educate themselves.

2. First of all, in the long term, people will get more if they know how to teach themselves. To be more specific, the knowledge in one certain area may be outdated, which means what you have learned will be useless, while the ability to teach themselves will last forever. 
3. Take Tom, a software engineer, as an example. During his school time, teachers just teach him some specific knowledge in the web area. With these skills, he gets an engineering job after graduating. However, the whole industry has changed and the former skills arrive at their expiry date, causing Tom and all the same position worker to lose their jobs. Tom then stays at home hopeless because society does not need his skills and he can do nothing else. Nevertheless, his work partner, who receives skills to educate himself, learns another new skill as soon as the trend changes and successfully gets a new job. 

4. Students with a strong ability to educate themselves can get better grades. Because the exam always has some questions that teachers often do not teach in the class. Students can only learn them by themselves.
5. Take me as an example. In my early senior high school time, I struggled with the math grades, which always disappoints me. When I consulted my teacher for help, he taught me to educate myself instead of some specific solving methods. After that, I began to do extra exercises books. Until the next examination, I had done twice more than others' exercises books. When I took the exam, to my surprise, I found too many similar questions, which are in my extra exercise but not taught by teachers. And without a doubt, the grades reward me with a significant improvement. It is the self-education that gives me such an unbelievable progress





















The topic pertinent to the issue of the utilization of AI has become hotly debated in contemporary society, among which is the discussion about whether people should use AI in the job interview. Some individuals propose that AI can reduce the burden of HR, citing the reason that the repeat working like asking the age or name can be done by AI. However, as far as I'm concerned, it is more conducive for HR not to use AI. I would provide several reasons in the following paragraphs. 

First of all, AI can not judge one person if he really fits the job. Because only human can ask and respond to those meaningful questions. AI, so far, can only handle some basic problems like where you are from, which usually are meaningless to the final result. Take Tom, an HR in Microsoft, as an example. Once the company needs to hire 3 internship people and it uses AI HR and human HR together, trying to test the accuracy of AI. At the beginning, the process on both sides goes through fluently because both of them just ask simple questions. However, when asking how they deal with one certain bug in coding, the AI can not make a judgment while the human can make a more suitable choice. The situation is the same as other open questions like how you deal with your relationship between colleagues. Finally, the choices made by AI are almost randomly, which means AI failed in making decisions in the job interview. 

Second, using AI is much more expensive than using human. To be more specific, AI needs more time, more human and material resources. Nevertheless, a human can be a qualified HR after a short training. For instance, in last summer vacation, I was interning as a software engineer in a small company. Once the company had a new project and needed to hire many new people but there was only one HR. Then the boss said he needs me to be an HR and I was sent to an HR training. The whole process only cost 1 thousand yuan and then I become an HR quickly. However, if the company needs to use AI, they need to hire more engineers to build an AI model and then engineers need to train the model many times, which costs much more than the HR training. So, no company would choose AI to assist or even replace HR, considering the cost factor. 

To sum up, considering the advantages of human HR, I believe that HR should not use AI in job interviews.

1. The topic pertinent to the issue of necessity of recording has become hotly debated in contemporary society, among which is the discussion about whether people should record many videos during big events. Some individuals propose that we should take no records, citing the reason that we should enjoy the process and have no time to take pictures. However, as far as I'm concerned, it is more conducive for people to record some important events. 
2. First, those recordings can help you memorize the meaningful events. Because humans' memories always fade with time, people can find valuable memories in their smart phones if they have recorded. 
3. Take me and my friend Tom as an example. Last summer vacation I participated in a summer camp and joined a basketball team. Every time we played games, one of our teammates Tom always took pictures, which seems to be not convenient. So, once I suggested him to put down the phone but he said these valuable memories are should and worth to be recorded. I did not agree with him until the last month. When we had a party with friends and shared experiences, I found my memory had gone. I could only remember that we had a game, but no details can be recalled. However, it was Tom who showed us pictures and reminded me of those events. At that time I came to realize that memory is not reliable.
4. Second, we can share the happiness better through those recordings. To be more specific, when we try to share one experience with others, sometimes all descriptions are not as good as a picture or a video.
5. For instance, I want to share my sister's wedding with my friends. I give out all my efforts to describe the happy expression on everyone's face. I even laugh out when telling some interesting things. However, my friends can not feel that happiness deeply due to my poor vocabulary. At least their expressions are not changed. So I decide to show them the wedding video. Without surprise, when they see the video, they all have the tiny smell on their face, which is not seen during the process of my telling. After watching, they can share their feelings while they just say good or nice or some other general words before.
6. In conclusion, considering the benefit inconvenience in sharing and memorizing, I believe that taking records does have more advantages, thus making it a better choice.

The topic pertinent to the issue of the aim of teaching has become hotly debated in contemporary society, among which is the discussion about whether the most important goal of education is to teach people how to teach themselves. Some individuals propose that teachers should teach more specific area knowledge, citing the reason that it can help students to find a job. However, as far as I' m concerned, it is more conducive for teachers to teach people how to study by themselves. I would provide several reasons in the following paragraphs. 

1. Students need to solve the problem independently. Teachers can not always accompany students. When students graduate from school and have some troubles, it is sure that their teachers can not help them anymore. So students need to improve their ability of self-study. 

   Take Tom, a doctor, as an example. When he studied at university, he always asked his teacher for assistance. Gradually he formed a bad habbit. He would not think the problem himself but asked the teacher as soon as he had some problems. During his school time, that behaviour would not result some damages to him but when he was graduated, all disadvantages were revealed. The school sent him to a medicine lab far from school and it had a lot of problems there. He was completely astonished the first day he arrived. He could solve none of them and he wanted to asked his teacher for help unconsciously at first. Not only his teachers could not reply him but also other colleagues are all busying doing their work. Two days later, he was fired out because he did no contribution to the lab. After this experience, he started to think problems independently and breed up his ability of self-study.

During his school time, that behavior would not result in some damage to him but when he was graduated, all disadvantages were revealed.

He could solve none of them and he wanted to ask his teacher for help unconsciously at first. Not only his teachers could not reply to him but also other colleagues were all busy doing their work. Two days later, he was fired out because he made no contribution to the lab. After this experience, he started to think about problems independently and bred up his ability to self-study.

   

2. The knowledge changes rapidly, which means that mastering the current knowledge is not enough. In the Internet era, the technology updates frequently and thus what you have learned will be possibly outdated. Following the new trend attaches more importance to the new requirement of prestigious companies.  

   Take me as an example. When I was a freshmen in the university, the popular fond-end technology is VUE, which is a kind of tools used in the web development. To achieve the dream of being a software engineer, I gave all of my efforts to study it. From day to night, I almost lived in the library and therefore I was confident to have the interview as I believed I had learned VUE completely. However, to my surprise, when I had the formal interview, the interviewer asked me the REACT, a completely new tool used in web development. I was shocked because it is my first time to hear this term. I could not remember how mant times I said "Sorry, I don't know". Finally, I did not get this job position. After that I came to realized that I should pay more attention to the ability to follow up the trend and that is the self-study ability.

1. Usually, people's older friends can give more effective working suggestions. If people are stuck by some obstacles that their friends have experienced before, those suggestions are the best key to solve the problems no matter they are totally the same or similar. 

   Take me as an example. During the last summer vacation, I had an intership as a software engineer with my same age friend Tom. I had met many problems at the first day. I could not solve the configuration of the new project, which is a web development project. I consulted Tom but he is stuck by the same problem I had met. Trying all possible solutions from what I had learned and some blogs, I still could not run the project. Finally I ask Mike, who have 3 years work experiences, for help. He looked at the screen for a minite and pointed out my problem. He said I made a mistake that freshmen usually made. Following his fingers, I found that I set a wrong route path. It was this tiny error that makes all programs inoperable. I could not solve this problem without Mike's assistance. 

2. In addition, older people have more experience in relationship. To be more specific, they can handle the timing better. They know what to do in what time. Usually their judgements are more reliable.  

   Take Tony as an instance. Last year, he fell in love with a lovely girl but hesitate for what he should do. If he directly invited the girl to have a date, he was afraid of a refusal because he did not know the opinion of that girl. If just he maintained the current relationship, he was afraid to miss the chance to express his love. His peer friends advise him trying to inviter her. However, when he asked his dad, he got a opposite suggestion. His dad said Tony should wait one more month and sent some tiny gifts in daily life. Tony was confuesd at first but still chose to accept his father's advice. A month later, he successfully had a date with the girl. At the dinner the girl said it is those gifts that make the girl consider that Tony is warm and lovely boy and might be a good boyfriend. Thanks to his father's suggestions, Tony succeed.

1. Volunteering at a museum is easier than volunteering at a hospital. 

2. To be more specific, students with some basic knowledge or even not know anything can be a volunteer at the museum after a short training. However, to be a volunteer at a hospital, you need to take a long training because taking care of patients needs to learn a lot of things that you may never hear before in daily life. 

3. Tom, a senior high school student, wanted to apply for a nurse in the last summer vacation. Waiting for a long time, he did not receive any interview announcement. He called the HR and was told his resume did not meet their standards. "You know nothing about any medical knowledge, which means you can not give any reasonable suggestion to the patient. What's more, you may fail in some operations that can determine the patient's life. We need to take responsibility for our patients. I'm sorry but we can not agree you to be a volunteer here." Nevertheless, when he sent his resume to a museum. He received an offer immediately. He was surprised and the staff told him that to be a volunteer in the museum just needs an enthusiasm heart. 

4. So, for the difficulty of application, a museum is a better choice. 

5. Working in the museum is much safer than working outside. Specifically, staying in an environment filled with wildlife animals is a dangerous choice for a student. 

6. Take me as an example, last holiday I was invited to be a volunteer in a nature conversation. Everything was good at the beginning until the first contact with animals. I was shocked by the elephant's huge body. I thought I would be sent to the hospital if I was hit by its nose. Even though the work staff said all animals are not aggressive,  I was still worried about my safety. When I fed the elephant, suddenly a monkey showed up and grabbed the banana in my hands. I was scared and stepped back unconsciously until my head was hit by a door. The bump was not serious but I still gave up this job for my safety. When I can apply for a volunteer again, I choose to go to a museum without any consideration. And I have a nice experience in the museum, at least I keep my body health there. 

7. All in all, there will be much more accidents than in a museum. 

   ![image-20220423140705935](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RNCHEN/photo-326/master/blogImg/image-20220423140705935.png)

构思花了一会

1. Providing students with classes will influence more people. 

      To be more specific, not many adults will choose to watch movies as their entertainment. However, at least most students want to take the extra classes to get good grades. 

      Take me as an example. When I was a senior high student, my city built a movie theater in the parks, trying to attract people and stimulate the consume. Frankly, the movie theater seemed fascinating and it was equipped with edge-cut player devices. However, the number of customers did not meet the government's expectations. According to a statistic we found that adults have many sorts of entertainment like going hiking or watching a sports game while watching movies is not ranking among the top 5. Then, the movie theater was destructed and a new school was built up. To administrators' surprise, more and more students came here because attending extra classes is an effective way to improve grades. Their family members also came here to take care of their kids. The number of people who came here exceeded expectations in a short time. 

   

2. 
   The behavior that providing students with classes can build a more positive reputation for the city. People hate repetition, which means too many advertisements may cause the opposite effect. 

   Take my city as an example. It had decided to advertise itself since the last year. It invited many celebrities to record videos and put many trailers online. During that time, people can watch the videos or relevant advertisements everyday when they open up the website. After a month, people felt bored watching the same video everyday. It caused a bad influence among those who may be potential customers. Gradually, people had a negative impression that this city loved to boost itself. Nevertheless, the neighbor city built a school during the same time. And many students decided to go there to attend school. Then the city leaved a good impression on these other province students. And when the statistic about the most popular city is revealed. My city is at the bottom while our neighbor city arrives at the top 10 among hundreds of cities.

Tht topic pertinent to the issue of the cheating on the homework assignments has become hotly debated in contemporary society, among which is the discussion about what is the best solution to prevent students from cheating anymore. Some individuals propose that asking parents to monitor, citing the reason that parents can directly monitor if the student cheats. Someone suggests to asking teacher to increase the difficulty of assignments so that students can ask no one for help. However, as far as I'm concerned, it is more conductive for school to increase the penalty for cheating. I would provide several reasons in the following paragraphs. 

5 min 

First, asking parents to monitor will just add more budern to parents while increasing the penalty wii not. It is the fact that parents are usually tired after a long-peroid work and they can not pay more attention to their kids' assignment. However, if the school increase the penalty, what parents need to do is just agree with the decision, which is easier. 

Take Tom as an example. 

> 重点是如何 decrease the number of cheating.

First, parents usually won't give their kids a hard punlishment, which is comparde to the school's penalty, thus making students feel free to cheat. The main reason is that parents will usually teach kids to not do that next time orally or do nothing ab

> 在效果而言！！！！
>
> 我现在是想不到怎么！！想不到！！！



First, increasing the penalty can make students afraid of cheating. To be more specific, if the punishment is serious, they need to consider more and will be afraid to cheat because they can not afford it. Take Tom ,as an example. 

Before the last final exam, the penalty for those cheaters was just writing a paper to express that they would never cheat again. However, you can imagine that this kind of punishment could not make students feel that they would pay any price for cheating while they could easily finish their homework. And Tom just still cheated because he could finish his assignments without any independent thinking and almost no punishment. In this term, the school modified its penalty that all cheaters will be asked to leave out the school. When he saw the statement, he knew that he could not do what he did before. It was the serious penalty that made him give up his cheating habit.

What's more, comparing with other two solutions, increasing the punishment is relativelty the most easist solutions. Specifically, asking parents to monitor will add some parents burden so that they may refuse and a more difficult homework may have the opposite effect. 

Take me as an example. When I was a senior high student. They school originally decided to ask parents to monitor students. To school's surprise, parents were almost all against this idea. They said that it was the school that should take the responsibility to monitor students. They parents were already tired after day-time working. This decision just made a bad influence on the reputation of school while did not make any progress in decreasing the number of cheaters. The situation is the same as the third choices. School found that the harder assignments just cause more students to copy the answer. The main reason is that only few students can work out hard questions, which means much more students can only rely on there clever students if they want to finish the task. As for increasing the penalty, no parents would disagree and they teachers still arrived their goal on teaching.

jump out this questions and we choose another topic to write.

The topic pertinent to the issue of students' study efficiency has become hotly debated in contemporary society, among which is the discussion about what is the best solution to improve student's productivity. Some individuals propose that they should know that they will receive a reward, citing the reason the result will stimulate students. Others suggest that they should do something they are really interested in, because they will study it from their deep heart. However, as far as I'm concerned, it is more conducive for students to have an environment free of noise. 

First, having a silent environment means you can research your assignment without being interrupted by others, which is more helpful than having a fantasy expectation. To be more specific, students who pay all attention to the problems can get grades while a good expectation sometimes distracts them.

Take me as an example. When I first came into a lab in school, I was excited because I was told that I could get a grade if I finished the task. So I worked hard day and night researching the task in my classroom, which is full of students and thus it was noisy. Every time I came to a good idea, there would be some accidents that interrupted me like someone may want to borrow my pen or ask questions. The accidents piled up and exerted a huge negative impact on me. Finally I failed to finish the task and my grades were not well. In the next term, I changed my work place to a silent library. The process went well as there would be no more accidents. I could just concentrate all my efforts on the task. To my surprise, my grades in that term is better than I thought.

What's more, usually we can decide where we learn but can not determine what we learn, which is limited to our majority. The main reason is that we can not change our majority easily even if we are not interested in it.

Take Tom as an example, he chose the AI as his major before entering the university but at that time he did not know if he was really interested in the area. Unfortunately, when he studied the area systematically, he found what he really wanted to learn was physics, but he could not change it because of school rules. However, he could select a silent place to study. In his university, there are too many classrooms and study rooms that he could always find a silent one. So in terms of feasibility, choosing a silent study place is easier.

To sum up, with the statement I argued above, I maintain that an environment free of noise and distractions is relatively the best solution among the three choices.

The topic pertinent to the issue of the ability of a modern student has become hotly debated in contemporary society, among which is the discussion about whether it is essential for young people to have the ability to plan and organize. Some individuals propose it is not necessary, citing the reason that students should pay more attention to the study and thus this ability is not important for them. However, as far as I'm concerned, it is more conducive for students to have this ability. I would provide several reasons in the following paragraphs.

First, planning and organizing ability is more helpful for their academic performances. To be more specific, a man with the planning ability usually have a clear mind about what he will do next and can concentrate more on the part that not solved, thus making them get better grades. 

Take me as an example. During my first year that I did not have this ability in senior high school, I struggled with my grades even though I studied from day to night. I just did many assignments but did not summarize and make a special plan to my study. As a result, I made the same mistakes again and again. My teacher told me that I could never make progress unless I could make a plan for my study. From then on, I started to learn to make a plan such as collecting the mistakes and researching the similarity of my mistakes. After a long time efforts, I built a clear mind about solving those questions. Finally, I made huge progress that term.

Second, this ability is also useful in the daily life because it can save our an amount of time and thus increase the work efficiency. The main reason is that we can use the waiting time if we organize.

For example, in the last summer vacation, I was working in a company, which has a lot of tasks. At the beginning, I was full of energy and solved all things one by one without making any plan. After 3 days work, I was not that enthusiastic anymore because I spent a lot of time waiting for the response. I found that if I still wasted the waiting time, the task would be finished at least 2 weeks later. Therefore I made a plan. I listed all events' waiting time and set their priorities. *I decided to f*inish the most emergency first and do the second emergency during the waiting time. Finally, to my surprise, I finished the whole task just one week. It is the behavior that planning things in advance that save my time.

To sum up, with the statement I argued above, I maintain that modern students should have the ability to plan and organize to live a better life.
