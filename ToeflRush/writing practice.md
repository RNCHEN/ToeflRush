自由选择专业问题

重点是利弊而不是上价值

1. First, children can have a better grades if they study the subject they like.

   To be more specific, children will probably devote all their hearts to the subject they like while they may refuse to absorb the knowledge from the course that does not intrigues them, which will result a huge difference in final acadamic grades.

   Take my best friend Jack as an example. His favorite subject was math and he had collected many extra-circullar books of the math since the junior high school, but he was demanded by his parents to choose the chemistry as his university major. In the fresh year, he almost dropped out, as he was indulged in the world of math in the dormitory and was abscent from almost all chemistry classes. Given his situation, his instructor had a communication with him and his parents. Learning his real desiration, the instructors suggested him to change his major to the math and then persavaded his parents. After backing to his familiar field, his talent helped him get the first position. What's more, he attended some math competition and got the national champion fianlly. 

   Had he not changed his major, he could not get such great awards.

2. Second, for teachers, they can have a better class environment and therefore a better teaching results. 

That is because those students who truely love the subject will respond to teachers' questions and interact with teachers positively. When students urge the knowledge, they will expect the coming class instead of doing nothing.

Take me as an example. I attented a summer campus and chose the physics class. To my surprise, on this class, all students loved the physics. Therefore, when teacher asked us to do some team works, no one escaped. During the discussion, all members tried to share their opinions no matter if it is practical. We finally got 10 different solutions, which surpriesd our teacher as well. He said in the last summer campus no one constrived even if one idea when he taught history students. In the following courses, we build a friendly atmosphere that encouraged everyone to ask questions or share their feelings liberately. Not only did teacher say he has never experienced such a fantasic summer campus, but also he taught us many extra knowledges that he won't teach in the normal situation. 

It is the true love of the physics that result in this amazing effect.

The topic pertinent to the issue of the length of one term has been hotly debated in contemporary society, among which is the discussion about if the university should have 9 months of study and 3 months break or a shorter study time. Some individual proposes that they should have a longer time of study, citing the reason that students can be less distracted as they know holidays are far away from them. However, as far as I'm concerned, I strongly hold that students should have a 3 month study and 1 month break. I would provide several reasons as follows. 

First, a long time study can instead reduce students' study efficiency. To be more specific, students need to have some rest between a long period of concentrating on the study, or they will feel anxious and tired of their assignment. What's more, teachers also need to have some relax, otherwise they can lose their passion about their lessons.

Take me as an example. When I was a senior high school students, before the National Holidays, our school adjust the time shedule, which causes us need to study for 11 days with out any break days. At first I thought I could overcome this obstracle but the reality is completely opposite. At the tenth day, when I finshed my assignment, I found that I have nothing in my mind even though I learned the knowledge in the day time. My grades at that time was amazingly low. The situation is the same with our teacher. On the last day of that extended study time, he was also tired of teaching, asking us to learn the book by ourselves. However, after a 5 days vacation, I found all people become positive about the study again. Teachers became dynamic and the interaction between teachers and students increased again. 

So, had we a longer time of study without enough break, we would have a lower study efficiency.

Second, it is a challenge for our parents to arrange their time. As we all know that children need their parents' accompanies, which means parents need to spare their work time to stay in home. If our parents are to be seperated from the work in a long time,
